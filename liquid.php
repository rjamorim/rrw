        Liquid Audio was, for a while, the only way you could come in contact
        with that hot new audio encoding technology from the same creators of the
        hugely popular MP3, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG): Advanced 
        Audio Coding (AAC).<br><br>
        
        See, the <a href=mp3prod.php>sudden and huge popularity of the MP3 format</a>
        created a big scare among recording studios and executives, and they were 
        quick to place part of the blame on MPEG in general and Fraunhofer in 
        particular for coming up with a technology that (in their misguided little
        minds) served for little more than assisting pirates distributing their 
        precious IP.<br><br>
        
        Wanting to avoid a public relations headache, not to mention the threat 
        of court battles, FhG vowed that AAC files would never exist in the wild
        as pure unprotected songs. They would only license their technology to
        developers interested in building systems around it providing strong DRM
        protections.<br><br>
        
        Fortunately years later they reversed that decision, probably realizing
        they were losing a lot of money with that idiotic restriction (after all, 
        mandatory DRM equals low popularity) only to abide to the tantrums of an
        industry living on borrowed time.<br><br>
        
        But in the few years that this policy stood, it was indeed very difficult
        for users to get access to unprotected AAC. They needed to be contented 
        with <a href=homeboy.php>slow and buggy encoders</a> <a href=mbsoft.php>
        based on reference sources</a> or know the right people (like me) that 
        could fix them with a copy of the latest version of <a href=aacenc.php>a
        quite better encoder, but nothing amazing</a> (compared to what we were 
        promised when AAC was launched).<br><br>
        
        So, in all this context we saw the launch of Liquid Audio. It was meant
        to be a huge, complete platform for (legal! protected!) digital music 
        sales and distribution. Despite initially being based on the <a 
        href=softencode.php>Dolby AC3</a> format, it only started catching 
        people's attention after it added AAC support.<br><br>
        
        The main tool enabling this platform was Liquifier, a very featureful 
        program meant to strip audio tracks of that pesky freedom to be shared 
        and played whenever and wherever. It had many features: line-in recorder,
        CD ripper, basic audio editor. You could add lots of information about 
        each track: title, artist, composer, lyrics, notes, album art, etc, etc. 
        And in the end, you could create the Liquid Master file, a single file 
        containing all the information and several different versions of the 
        track (encoded at diferent bitrates and/or different encoders, each 
        version with customizable rights: burn to CD, export to device, export 
        to MP3, expiry date... Also, the free versions can be created as only 
        short clips, not the entire track).<br><br>
        
        <a href="screens/LiquidPlayer.png" target=_blank><img src="screens/LiquidPlayer.png" 
        alt="Liquid Player for Windows 5.0" align=right height=290></a>
        The encoders available in version 5.0 were AAC (FhG), AC3 (Dolby), and 
        <a href=mp3enc.php>MP3</a> (FhG); with bitrates as low as 8kbps for 
        modem streaming and as high as 256kbps for "CD Quality". The player 
        version 5.1 for Mac hints at the addition of <a href=sonicstage.php>Sony
        ATRAC3</a> as a choice of encoder.<br><br>
        
        Below you have the Liquifier 5.0 installer for Win32 and the cracked
        executable zipped together with a cracking instructions file. It is
        worth mentioning that the installer refuses to run on Windows XP, I
        suspect it is locked to only run on Windows 9x and Me (but I did not 
        try it on Windows NT 4 or 2000). Also, you can have a pre-cracked ZIP 
        package that you can extract and run on whichever Windows version - even
        Windows 10, if you provide the required DLL - and it will just work.
        <br><br>
        
        The player was pretty but not very featureful. It seems more interested 
        in finding a way to display all the countless metadata that can come
        with the track than providing actually useful features such as equalizer
        and a playlist manager.<br><br>
        
        Finally, as I mentioned before Liquifier creates LQM - Liquid Master - 
        files. And the players only play LQT - Liquid Track - files. The idea is
        that recording studios would use Liquifier to generate masters according 
        to their specifications and the necessary information, and then submit
        these masters to the Liquid Servers. These were in charge of processing 
        payments from customers and providing them LQTs derived from masters. Of 
        course these servers have gone offline decades ago, so if you want to 
        try Liquid Audio for yourself you will need the little lqm2lqt tool that
        does exactly that - converts LQM to LQT tracks so they can be played on 
        Liquid Player.<br><br>
        
        Liquid Audio enjoyed some success for a few years but could not compete
        with better established competitors in the music distribution arena such
        as Real Networks with Real Audio and Microsoft with WMA. It disappeared
        in the early 2000s, and you can still see a mirror of the site at the <a
        href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000301013659/http://www.liquidaudio.com/"
        target=_blank>Internet Archive</a>.<br><br>
