                  I added screenshots to most (all?) graphical programs in ReallyRareWares. Some are bland,
                  some are amazing, several are just horrid. Have fun perusing them!<br><br>

                  Besides the screenshots, these are the novelties:

                  This update includes something I have been meaning to add to RRW for years: screenshots!<br><br>

                  Check the pages of your favorite graphical applications (I do not see much point in adding
                  screenshots of command line applications), maybe there will be a screenshot there. I have not
                  yet uploaded screenshots for all apps, those will probably come in the next update.<br><br>

                  Besides the screenshots, this is what has been added/updated:
                  <ul>
                    <li>A page for the MP3 PlusV encoder (thanks to Zachary Jelesoff)</li>
                    <li>A page for the AMP MP3 decoder - famously used in early versions of Winamp (thanks to Martin Guy)</li>
                    <li>Apollo MP3 player (thanks to [Jaz])</li>
                    <li>Several VQF updates: NTT player and VQF SDK, Yamaha player and another version of the encoder</li>

                  This is what has been added/updated:

                  After more than ten years of inactivity, I believe it is about time to bring
                  ReallyRareWares back.<br><br>

                  I stupidly let my other domain - rjamorim.com - expire and then it got stolen
                  by one of those jolly domain squatters. That made me lose interest in the project
                  somewhat. But I never stopped receiving e-mails from people asking for software
                  I used to host here, and that showed me there was still interest in old, weird
                  or just interesting pieces of audio software.<br><br>

                  These last few weeks I did a major cleanup. Replaced dead links with archive.org
                  mirrors or deleted them altogether, fixed several spelling and grammar mistakes,
                  fixed visuals on some pages.<br><br>

                  Now in the next few weeks/months I'll go back to updating. I have a small
                  backlog of stuff I received from friends and contacts at HA to upload, and also
                  should create articles for tools that have come and gone during this time - for
                  example, the FhG MP3 Surround and CodingTechnologies MP3pro encoders.
                  <br><br>

                  I would also like to count on you, friends and visitors, to send me software that
                  you believe belongs here, or send corrections/additions to the articles. I'd like,
                  for instance, to add the versions I missed of some of the tools available here (EAC,
                  LAME, foobar2000...)<br><br>

                  Thank you for your patience all those years!<br><br>

                  Best regards;<br><br>

                  update to ReallyRareWares: A much improved Musepack section, reflecting the recent

                  There are countless Musepack versions there, most of them kindly contributed by

                  I was planning to only make an update near Christmas, but so many nice dudes
                  submitted old versions of foobar2000 that I decided to make a quick update and
                  add a foobar page to the site.<br><br>

                  The collection is still far from complete, therefore, if you happen to have an old
                  version of this player not yet featured at the foobar page, please send it to
                  my e-mail address (available at the About page)<br><br>

                  Also, I added a hidden surprise. Look around for it, and you'll eventually find...

                  Hello. I'm here bringing you some Christmas gifts taken out from obscure
                  and forgotten places in the web.<br><br>
                  
                  For starters, an unexpected development: Mr. Volodymyr Poltavets actually took
                  his time to adapt Split2000 to modern Linux versions. You can find his diff
                  files and precompiled binaries at the Split2000 page.<br><br>
                  
                  Just for sake of completeness, I added several TruesSpeech players for different
                  platforms: Win16, Mac68K and MacPPC.<br><br>
                  
                  Mr. Zack Jelesoff pointed me out to updates on the Mio encoder (Daru) and Winamp
                  plugin, so they have been updated at the Mio page.<br><br>
                  
                  I also added browser plugins for Echospeech playback, for Win32 and Win16.<br><br>
                  
                  Finally, I added a page for rare or deprecated CoolEdit/Audition import/
                  export filters.

                  Today I added to the lame page several very old versions, courtesy of 
                  384kbps. Included are some versions that seem to only work in OS/2.<br><br>
                  
                  I'm also opening an exception and adding an audio editor to the collection:
                  CoolEdit 1.3.1, a Win16 version of the famous editor dating from 1993!<br><br>
                  
                  Last but not least, I added some interesting programs submitted by the always
                  helpful <a href="http://mark0.net/" target=outside>Marco Pontello</a>. They
                  are VocPack - an extremely old lossless compressor - and wav2mp, an MP1/MP2
                  encoder.

                  First, I would like to assure visitors that I haven't forgotten about RRW.
                  You don't need to worry when 4 months pass by without updates. By its nature,
                  RRW will be updated very seldomly from now on, since I already uploaded pretty
                  much my entire collection of rarities and you don't find rare audio-related
                  programs everyday.<br><br>
                  
                  Today, I uploaded several new versions of l3enc, including a version even older
                  than 1.0 (0.99a!). According to l3enc's history.txt, this is the second version 
                  released to the public - the first was 0.99, that I couldn't find anywhere.<br><br>
                  Last but not least, I would like to ask visitors to check if they have the very
                  infamous Mafuka encoder and decoder lying somewhere. I would love to feature it 
                  here, and extensive web searches resulted in no leads. If you have it, please
                  drop me a mail.

                  Coming from the premier resource of oddities and weirdness (to western eyes
                  anyway) - Japan - is the very rare and virtually unknown Mio format. A page
                  about it has been just added to the Weird Formats section.

                  In this update, I added old versions of the popular WavPack lossless audio 
                  encoder, and a Players section featuring several old audio players.

                  I finally ceased slacking and updated several parts of the site:
                  <ul>
                      <li>FhG MP3enc MP3 encoder</li>

                      <li>Arminio Grgic's very strange WavSquiq</li>
                      <li>MPEGplus SV5 apps, including a very rare decoding library</li>
                  </ul>
                  Hopefully the updates will be more frequent now.

                  I just added to the MP3 section a real rarity: l3enc 1.00 for DOS.<br><br>
                  
                  This was the first publicly available MP3 (back then called MPEG layer 3)
                  software encoder, released on June 1994. And it still works, creating
                  perfectly compliant (at least on my limited tests) MP3 streams!

                  Hello, and welcome to ReallyRareWares, a site for researchers
                  (or nostalgic people like me) that miss the old days of multimedia
                  encoding. <br><br>
                  
                  Here you'll find reviews and history of old software (encoders and 
                  decoders), deceased codecs (VQF, ePAC), oddities (AUPECg2, Astrid
                  AAC), and so on, as well as downloads. <br><br>
                  
                  Also, I count on your help to make this collection more complete.
                  If you have some very rare and old audio encoder or decoder which 
                  isn't featured here, please drop me a <a href="about.php">mail</a>.
                  Information on historical facts and corrections to the articles 
                  featured here are also very welcome.<br><br>
                  
                  Enjoy!<br><br>
