        SonicStage is an audio library manager created by Sony to integrate with
        their MiniDisc devices. The installation is bloated, takes forever and 
        installs all kinds of drivers and barely-related crap on your Windows. 
        Versions earlier than 3.3 mandate DRM on all tracks ripped from CD or 
        converted with SonicStage. The user interface is quite unintuitive (that 
        being said, 4.3 seemed friendlier than 2.0 in the short time I used 
        them).<br><br>
        
        But I did not create this page to complain about SonicStage. I am here 
        to talk about ATRAC, which is Sony's audio compression format, and 
        SonicStage just happens to be an encoder.<br><br>
        
        ATRAC - Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding - started being developed by 
        Sony in the early nineties as an audio data reduction technique to be 
        employed in their movie theater audio system - SDDS (Sony Dynamic Digital 
        Sound) - that encoded 7.1 audio streams in 1168kbps and stored the data 
        optically next to the film stock sprockets. In this capacity it competed 
        with the <a href=softencode.php>Dolby AC3</a> and DTS formats.<br><br>
        
        Around the same time, Sony was working on a magneto-optical audio storage
        and playback system called MiniDisc that was launched in 1992 and used 
        ATRAC to compress audio, reducing CD quality streams from 1411kbps 
        (uncompressed) to 292kbps - or 146kbps in mono mode. There are several 
        backwards- and forwards-compatible versions of the ATRAC encoder created
        by Sony, from v1 to v4.5 (and then, Type R and Type S), and it is said 
        it only started sounding good in version 3. Other MiniDisc manufacturers
        like Panasonic and Sharp also released their own tuned versions of the 
        encoder.<br><br>
        
        In 1999 Sony launched the first major upgrade to the ATRAC format with 
        the release of ATRAC3. It was introduced as a response to the perceived 
        technological superiority of the MP3 format (similar quality at much 
        smaller bitrates), so ATRAC3 claims to achieve transparency in LP2 mode 
        at 132kbps. There is also an LP4 mode that stores tracks in 66kbps but 
        with noticeable quality degradation. While being based on ATRAC, it is 
        not backwards compatible as it includes several coding improvements and 
        modified algorithms - therefore it will not work with original MiniDisc 
        players, only with newer MDLP (MiniDisc Long Play) devices.<br><br>
        
        The next upgrade of the format is called ATRAC3plus and was launched in 
        2003, still based on the same underlying technologies but with further 
        backwards-incompatible improvements. It offers bitrates ranging from 48
        to 352kbps and is only compatible with Hi-MD MiniDisc devices (but also
        compatible with several other Sony devices such as VAIO cell phones, PS3
        and PSP gaming consoles, and Xplod car players).<br><br>
        
        A parallel iteration of the format is ATRAC Advanced Lossless, in which 
        an audio stream is encoded in ATRAC3 or ATRAC3plus and the "discarded"
        audio data is losslessly compressed and merged to the lossy stream. That
        way, players that understand the extra data can play lossless audio,
        and older players that do not can play the normal lossy stream. It is 
        the same idea implemented by <a href=fhgmp3hd.php>mp3HD</a>, <a 
        href=wavpack.php>WavPack</a> hybrid mode and OptimFrog DualStream. 
        Compression performance is quite bad, yielding ratios similar to <a 
        href=daxwav.php>Dakx</a>.<br><br>
        
        The latest iteration of the format was released in 2011 and is called 
        ATRAC9. It is focused on video game audio for Sony consoles, offering 
        low delay and low CPU usage, and a new technology called <a target=_blank
        href="https://github.com/Thealexbarney/VGAudio/blob/master/docs/audio-formats/atrac9/band-extension.md"
        >Band Extension</a> that seems to be a variation of <a href=ctmp3pro.php
        >SBR</a>.<br><br>
        
        Besides being implemented in several hardware devices and software 
        programs created by Sony, the format has been licensed to other MiniDisc
        manufacturers such as Kenwood, Panasonic, Pioneer, Sanyo, Sharp, etc.; 
        to Real Networks as the audio compression engine in <a href=realjuke.php
        >Real Audio 8</a>; and to <a href=liquid.php>Liquid Audio<a/> as a format 
        option in their platform</a>.<br><br>
        
        In addition to SonicStage, here you'll find a collection of command line
        ATRAC3plus and ATRAC9 encoders and decoders extracted from various Sony 
        video game SDKs. They all produce weird RIFF-wrapped ATRAC streams, but 
        with different capabilities. For instance, tools for portable devices 
        (PSP and PS Vita) do not support multichannel audio. The PS3 tool only 
        supports 48kHz streams, while the PSP one only suports 44.1kHz streams, 
        and the PS4 and PS Vita tools seem to support all major frequencies. PS3
        and PSP tools only support ATRAC3plus while PS4 and PS Vita only support
        ATRAC9. And it seems none of them support ATRAC Advanced Lossless...
        <br><br>
        
        You can also try the Sony ATRAC3 ACM codec, available below. It integrates 
        with the Windows <a href=acmstation.php>Audio Compression Manager</a> and
        encodes to ATRAC3 files wrapped in the WAV container, allowing bitrates 
        of 66, 105 and 132kbps. Keep in mind this is quite old code and probably
        does not reflect the best quality ATRAC3 can offer.<br><br>

        And if you're still using Winamp, feel free to grab the in_atrac3 plugin
        below, developed by Daijoubu. The interface seems to be in Japanese and
        it is quite confusing. It will only work with OpenMG (*.oma) unprotected
        ATRAC3 or ATRAC3plus files - like the ones encoded by SonicStage. It can
        also work with *.aa3 files (as encoded by, E.G, Sound Forge + its plugin
        below), but you will first have to rename the extension to .oma. I could
        not get it to work with tracks encoded by the PS3 or PSP encoding tools.
        <br><br>
        
        None of the ATRAC versions and iterations has ever been standardized or 
        publicly documented, which in part explains the small popularity the 
        format enjoys outside the Sony world. There is no VBR encoding at all 
        and while there are multichannel capabilities in ATRAC3plus and ATRAC9, 
        it is quite hard to find encoders and decoders that support them. But 
        the FFMPEG project reverse engineered, and provides decoders for, all 
        iterations of ATRAC in their libavcodec library.<br><br>
        
        Since the early 2010s Sony appears to be de-emphasizing the use of ATRAC, 
        at least for end-users. Versions of SonicStage - now renamed as "Music
        Center" - released since that time do not offer the format as an option 
        for ripping CDs, the only choices are MP3, AAC, WAV, and FLAC. And the 
        latest version of Music Center goes as far as introducing functionality
        that can automatically <a href="screens/convertatrac.png" target=_blank>
        convert all ATRAC songs</a> it finds in the user's library to AAC or 
        FLAC.<br><br>
