        <p><i><b>Part of the following story is flawed. I'm leaving it here for 
        humour purposes. For a more truthful depiction of what really happened, 
        read the bottom of the page.</b></i></p>
        
        Once upon a time, an alpha of Sonique 2 was leaked (note: this isn't the 
        alpha/beta that was available for a while in the the official <a target=outside
        href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050307093203/http://sonique.lycos.com/">
        Sonique</a> page. That beta - now dead too - was developed by the new 
        development team. The alpha here was developed by the original team).<br><br>
        
        I remember Sonique fans were completely hysterical about this alpha. They 
        went to great lenghts to shut down every site hosting it, supposedly out 
        of fear Lycos would drop development because of this high treason. The 
        real reason, of course, is that they wanted to be the only "kool boyz" to 
        own such a rare tool and flaunter it in front of helpless newbies that 
        badly wanted it too.<br><br>
        
        A good image of how things were dealt with those days at the Sonique 
        forums can be depicted by <a href="files/players/asl.txt" target=outside>
        this protest article</a> that was posted at one of them.<br><br>
        
        Unfortunately for them, a copy landed in my hands. In yet another attempt 
        to prove my theory that "once something appears on the Internet, no amount 
        of effort can take it down", I hosted it, accompanied by a very crude 
        page, at my university server. And so <a href="https://www.rarewares.org" 
        target=outside>RareWares</a> was born.<br><br>
        
        So here it is for you. The rage-inducing Sonique 2 alpha in all its 
        unfinished glory. The interface is quite bloated, matter of factly, and 
        functionality is minimal. Maybe I am not really into eye-candy overkill...
        If this was the future of Sonique, it is not a surprise it completely 
        bombed.<br><br>
        
        Ah, yes. As it turns out, Lycos noticed they were just wasting money 
        with their Sonique division and decided to fire all developers. An 
        outcry ensued, and they hired two new developers to continue Sonique 2 
        development. Soon after, though, they realized they owed nothing to a 
        handful of squabbling nerds with too much time on their hands, and 
        finally let Sonique die a (mostly) peaceful death.<br><br>

        <li><p>Feedback from Bits:</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <i><p>Andrew McCann himself stated/requested/pleaded that the leak needed 
        to be stopped (as he was in negotiations to buy Sonique2 from Lycos), the 
        leak could have potentially screwed things. (BTW it was leaked only 
        accidently by Tony Million as he left it in a open dir on his private 
        (yet publically accessible) home server @ http://www.tonymillion.com))</p>
        
        <p>So it was nothing to do with fanboys trying to stop the world getting 
        it.. it was merely holding back the leak until after negotiations had 
        finished..</p>
        
        <p>Secondly, the skin in the leaked alpha was merely a working demo and 
        never intended to even ship with the player.. ever.</p>

        <p>Thirdly Lycos sacked all bar Andrew and Ian.. Lycos did not intend to 
        kill Sonique ever.. when Andrew and Ian quit on their own accord, Lycos 
        later decided to locate more people to develop a program they never 
        actually tried to completely kill (they merely needed to cut it back)</p>
        
        <p>Of course all said is only to the best of my knowledge (I was there
        the hour the alpha was found on Tony's ftp, I was talking to Tony when 
        he said it was an accident but added (in the direction to the likes of 
        Andrew and co.) "at least someone had the balls to release it" (or 
        something close to that))</p>

        <p>I was there when Andrew requested the leak to be stopped as soon as
        possible as it was potentially making things much worse for Sonique (he 
        said it via the forum, IRC and ICQ, plus his girlfriend at the time Anna 
        did as well, who BTW was the one who originally broke the month long 
        silence about the mass layoff of Team Sonique).</p>
        
        <p>Of course I am not Andrew or Tony or Ian and can't speak for them. 
        But my story is about 100x closer to what really happened compared to 
        yours (I am confident my version is rather accurate)</p>
        
        <p>To conclude the epic Sonique tale... Tony wrote Tuniac after he left 
        Sonique (http://www.tuniac.com, or for a more recent compile go to 
        http://www.wasteofcash.com/tuniac/)</p>

        <p>Currently we are lazy, and Tony believes he is now a photographer not
        a programmer. Blur is MIA. Tuniac2 with an OpenGL GUI, SQL database, 
        etc, etc. is like 10% done (and for a  month.. or two... has had no 
        updates)</p></i>
