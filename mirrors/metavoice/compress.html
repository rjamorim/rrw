<P>
How does Voxware's compression differ from other conventional methods?  Let's use an apple pie as a metaphor for transmitting voice over the Internet.  
<P>
Suppose you wanted to ship an apple pie across the US.  To send the pie by regular mail, conventional compression methods would drain the water out of the pie, send it freeze-dried, and then rehydrate the pie when it arrives at its destination.  The pie is compressed and optimized for shipping, but it is received in a freeze-dried condition, <B>much different from the original pie</B>.
<P>
Voxware's compression method analyzes the pie closely, breaks it down into its components, and ships the recipe (number of apples, amount of cinnamon...).  The pie is then baked once it is received at its destination.  Since this method actually sends a recipe of the original, the result is a perfect rebuilding of the pie. This metaphor shows how Voxware's MetaVoice technology produces an <B>accurate recreation of the human voice</B>.
<P>
