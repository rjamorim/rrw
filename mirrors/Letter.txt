Dear Mr.Christophe Thibault

On receiving your reply we felt grateful for the understanding shown 
by you, but we have been disappointed in your subsequent actions.
I have laid out below Yamaha's thinking on this issue; I hope that you 
will tackle on the problem immediately and do all you can to ensure that 
VQF is diffused in its proper form.

SoundVQ was developed on the basis of NTT's Twin VQ technology, with an 
immense investment by Yamaha.
At the present time Yamaha has no intention of releasing the program source.
We hope that you will understand the import of this mail and put the 
following measures into effect voluntarily.

*Cessation of the distribution of all related software,and the destruction 
 of all data.
*Announcement on your home page of the reasons for the cessation of
 distribution.
*Cessation hereafter of all software development which appropriates program
 sources to which Yamaha holds the rights and titles.


Reasons
1.<Distribution of Kjofol 0.401 packaged with decode32.dll on www.vqf.com>
<Kjofol 0.401> is inappropriate software completely identical to the content 
of kjofol_032.zip, as already pointed out by Yamaha.
This software does not reflect at all any of the points addressed by Yamaha,
and we cannot help but doubt that your reply is an indication of your true 
intentions.
It is not that Yamaha is making a problem out of kjofol_032.zip alone.

2.<winamp plugin for VQF> and <Distribution of K-jofol v0.401 on www.vqf.de>
These items of software cannot be used without violating content banned by
Yamaha.
We have actually been receiving inquiries from your users, asking "whether 
the execution in the Readme file attached to this software is not right ?".


We at Yamaha do not wish to think that it is your intention that VQF be 
diffused in this kind of inappropriate form.

Sincerely yours,

Yamaha Corporation
XG Division
Genichi Ito
