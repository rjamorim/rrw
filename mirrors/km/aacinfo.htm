<h3>AAC PROGRAMS</h3>
<STRONG>AAC (MPEG2-AAC)</STRONG> is an encoding scheme designed to<BR>
give the highest audio quality in smallest filesize / bitrate.<BR>
AAC uses a complex enoding algorithm to achieve this and<BR>
it has been refined since the first source code was released<BR>
(in november 97).<BR>
So far we have seen several versions of AAC and its quite<BR>
confusing. I think that ISO-compliance is the main factor in<BR>
establishing a common platform for AAC development.<BR>
<IMG SRC="hb000000.gif" ALIGN="right"width="250" height="180">

A legal AAC encoder requires licensing from Dolby, of the<BR>
mentioned ones only Liquifier is licensed at present.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>HOMEBOY AAC.</STRONG>  (ISO compliant - lo quality)<BR>
The first public AAC encoder was the Homeboy AAC encoder,<BR>
it worked but wasnt very good sound quality and not fast<BR>
either (real slow actually).<BR>
For some time there were no AAC player available (hmm) , <BR>
but when BitAAC came out it was possible to play the AAC <BR>
files. There is also a Winamp PLUG-IN from Homeboy.<BR>

<STRONG>PsyTEL AAC.</STRONG> (ISO compliant - lo quality)<BR>
A newly released AAC encoder, Psytel AAC is quite similar<BR>
to Homeboy AAC, but better sound quality though.<BR>
The encoding speed is slow and it also uses "dummy" modules<BR>
like the HB, which gives low sound quality (of course).<BR>
This AAC encoder seems to be in development and it shall be<BR>
interesting to follow. There seems to be some confusion with<BR>
what player to use as some of the other "ISO-compliant" players<BR>
wont play the files.<BR>

<STRONG>ASTRID/QUARTEX AAC.</STRONG>  (non ISO-compliant - better quality)<BR>
A new AAC encoder, Astrid/Quartex was released in october 98<BR>
and it was based on AAC/MP4 source from NTT (creator of TwinVQ).<BR>
The sound quality was much better but it was still kind of slow.<BR>
Kjofol 04/05 was the only player for these AAC files (non ISO <BR>
compliant) and in november 98 development of Atrid/Quartex stopped.<BR>
Astrid 02 has a good frequency response to 18 kHz.<BR><BR><BR>

<STRONG>K+K AAC. New AAC PROJECT</STRONG>  (ISO-compliant - high quality) <BR>
<IMG SRC="kkaac000.jpg" ALIGN="right"width="250" height="180">

I am delighted to present a new high-quality AAC software package.<BR>
I am involved in development and we call it K+K AAC.<BR>
So far we have a full ISO-compliant AAC encoder with better sound<BR>
quality than Astrid/Quartex, we have an AAC decoder and we have<BR>
an AAC plug-in for Winamp (the most populat MP3/multiformat player).<BR>
All 3 AAC profiles are supported (Main, LC and SSR) and this encoder<BR>
has a very good frequency response to over 20 kHz.<BR><BR>

Recent listening tests has shown that K+K AAC is somewhat better than<BR>
Liquifier Pro (with Fraunhofer AAC) and also that AAC files (in 128 kbps)<BR><P ALIGN="right">K+K AAC 10 - 128 kbps </P>
is full CD/wav quality, actually they were on several occasions asumed<BR>
to be the wav original because of its better sound quality (!).<BR>
One may ask what software the MPEG listenings tests were made with<BR>
and if this can be improved even further.<BR><BR>


<STRONG>LIQUIFIER PRO.</STRONG>  (Non ISO-compliant - high quality)<BR>
<IMG SRC="liquifie.gif" ALIGN="right" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="180">
Liquid Audio is using AAC (and Dolby AC3) technology in their web-<BR>
music distribution program; Liquifier Pro 4.0<BR>
I have worked as a beta-tester for this program and thus I have a<BR>
very good reference for judging AAC encoders (and other audio <BR>
compression).<BR>
With its fully optimized AAC encoding Liquifier is "the real thing" <BR>
but our project (K+K AAC) is better sound quality.<BR><BR>
You can find more, detailed information about AAC here ;<BR>

<H3>AAC TECHNOLOGY</H3><BR>

    MPEG-2 AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) is the latest MPEG standard on perceptual<BR>
audio coding. It is an extension of existing standards towards optimum coding<BR>
efficiency. AAC is not compatible with MPEG Audio Layers 1, 2, 3, that's why AAC<BR>
was called NBC (Non Backwards Compatible).<BR><BR>

There are three AAC profiles<BR><BR>

• Main<BR>
• Low Complexity (LC)<BR>
• Scaleable Sampling Rate (SSR)<BR>
<BR>
The Main profile includes all tools available and delivers the best audio quality<BR>
of the three profiles. The LC (low complexity) profile comes along with a limited<BR>
Temporal Noise Shaping tool and without prediction. This reduces audio quality for<BR>
some special audio signals but saves a lot of computational power in both encoding<BR>
and especially decoding. The SSR profile (Scaleable Sampling Rate) is a low complexity<BR>
profile with a different filterbank and a special gain control tool.<BR><BR>

AAC has sampling frequencies between 8 kHz and 96 kHz and any number of channels<BR>
between 1 and 48, the AAC is well prepared for future developments in the audio<BR>
and cinema sectors.<BR><BR>

Like all perceptual coding schemes, MPEG-2 AAC basically makes use of the signal<BR>
masking properties of the human ear in order to reduce the amount of data.<BR><BR>

The AAC uses these techniques<BR><BR>

• Huffman Coding<BR>
• Quantization and scaling<BR>
• M/S Matrixing<BR>
• Intensity Stereo<BR>
• Coupling Channel<BR>
• Backward adaptive prediction<BR>
• Temporal noise shaping (TNS)<BR>
• Modified discrete cosine transform (IMDCT)<BR>
• Gain control and hybrid filter bank (polyphase quadrature filter + IMDCT)<BR>
<BR>
AAC Main 128, gives significantly better performance than MP2-192 or MP3-128.<BR>
In addition, AAC Main 96 gives better performance than MP3 128. These comparisons<BR>
are only tru for fully optimized AAC.<BR><BR>

The AAC Main 128 was indistinguishable from the original for 80% of professional<BR>
listeners (in tests performed by Mpeg organization).<BR>
We have repeated these tests and can confirm it, actually we think that the figure<BR>
is over 90% <BR>

The compression ratio is around a factor of 2 better compared to MPEG Layer 2 and<BR>
still a factor of around 1.4 better than MPEG Layer 3 (MP3). This means that <BR>
compared to Layer 3, you get the same quality (better actually) at 70% of the bitrate.<BR><BR>

You need a Pentium PC 90MHz or above to decode MPEG-2 AAC in realtime, and encoding<BR>
time is like 4 times track length on a P2-300.<BR><BR>

MPEG-2 AAC is the Data Compression for the 21st Century and AAC shall be incorporated<BR>
(with Twin VQ) in MP4.<BR><BR>
MP4 AAC shall be similar to MPEG2-AAC and a MP4 player shall play AAC files. In addition<BR>
MP4 shall incorporate features to improve lower bitrates, to adapt to various bitrates<BR>
(multi-bitrates) and facilitate better streaming in lower bitrates also.<BR>
