<H3>My Background.</H3><BR>
I have been working with compressed audio for a while,<BR>
and with pro-audio and hifi for more than 20 years.<BR><BR>
I also do beta-testing for several companies, with<BR>
audio quality as my prime area of interest. <BR>
I know it is subjective so this is basically my <BR>
experience with audio compression systems, you<BR>
are recommended to make yours.<BR><BR>

<h3>Reference Setup</h3>
<BR>
I am delighted to report that I have chosen a new <BR>
Reference Setup again, the K+K MP02 TAC package.<BR><BR>
I am part of developing this and as such I cant be<BR>
completely objective about it, but i still think I can<BR>
give some facts and info about it and other formats.<BR><BR>
It gives reference audio quality (like lossless)<BR>
compression, LPAC .... in high bitrates and with its<BR>
ABM (adaptive bitrate managing) it also gives best<BR>
possible audio compression in lower bitrates, actually<BR>
down to below 100 kbps.<BR><BR>
You can see on the graph that freq. response is flat<BR>
to beyond 20 kHz and the sound quality is very good too.<BR>
The player is a plugin for Winamp 2.xx (the most popular)<BR>
multiformat player.<BR><BR>
The K+K MP02 TAC package isnt released yet , but it is <BR>
scheduled for a release around late june 99.<BR>
I shall come back with more news as soon as I have it.<BR><BR>
You can find link below to K+K homepage with TAC demos.<BR>
<IMG SRC="mp02fr00.gif" align="right" WIDTH="280" HEIGHT="300">
<BR>
My favorite CD-RIPPERs are EAC 081 and CDEX 015<BR>
<BR>
COMPARING AND RATING SYSTEMS.<BR>
I have encoded 5 different tracks and compared the sound<BR>
quality of these tracks encoded with different programs and<BR>
in different formats.<BR>
<BR>
I have played the tracks through a high-quality soundcard,<BR>
a high-quality HIFI power amp and a set of high quality<BR>
HIFI speakers. (CAD/AUDAX)<BR>
<BR>
A new rating has been devised, Best sound quality in same<BR>
bitrate, meaning best sound quality with smallest files.<BR>
The rating also uses "points" so you can compare quality<BR>
from one bitrate to another (10 points is best quality).<BR>

<h3>MP2 Systems</h3>

MP2 is mostly used in the pro-audio field, for film and<BR>
radio and has also been proposed for DVD. There are few<BR>
software MP2 encoders (a great deal of hardware encoders<BR>
though) and also few dedicated MP2 players.<BR>
Many MP3 players can play MP2 files also, Winamp, Wplay...<BR><BR>

MP2 was released before MP3, to my ears it has better<BR>
sound quality, I believe because MP2 encoding isnt<BR>
tweaking the wav files so much. Another feature of MP2<BR>
is that the CPU usage is generally lower.<BR>
<BR><BR>
Only disadvantage is the somewhat larger files<BR>
(MP2-192 is 50% larger than MP3 in 128 kbps).<BR>
<BR><BR><img src="philmpeg.jpg" align="right" width="250" height="170">

There is however still development done in MP2,<BR>
mostly reducing encoding time.<BR>
<BR><BR>
Lately I have tested a number of MP2 encoders, LINK<BR>
to test here:<a href="mp2test.htm">TEST OF MP2 ENCODERS</a>
<BR><BR>
Tested MP2 encoders are:<BR>
Record-It (Iomega)<BR>
MpegDJencoder (Xaudio) (fastest)<BR>
MP2ENC (Wav2mp)<BR>
SoundLimit 2.0<BR>
Qdesign Imedia 2 (best quality)<BR>
<BR><BR>
Preferred bitrate is 192 kbps, giving very high<BR>
audio quality and reasonable size files.<BR>
<BR><BR>
The main difference between MP2-192 and MP3 (128 and up)<BR>
is that the sound is more open, natural and dynamic.<BR>
MP2 does not have the phasing , squishy effect of some MP3s<BR>
and it does not have the distant and dull character of VQF.<BR>
<BR><BR>
Best MP2 programs are:<BR><BR>

RIPPERS: (also for the other formats)<BR>
CDEX 015<BR>
EAC 081<BR>

<h3>MP3 Systems</h3>
<IMG SRC="aaproduc.jpg" ALIGN="right"WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="200">

MP3 (Mpeg 1 Layer 3) is the most common audio<BR>
compression system around. There are many encoders,<BR>
lots of players, some rippers/encoders , etc.<BR>
Looking for the best in audio quality will quickly<BR>
sort out the majority of them. I have made a list<BR>
of the best programs with audio quality in focus;<BR><BR>
Best MP3 programs are:<BR><BR>
RIPPERS:<BR>
EAC 081b (FREE)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ENCODERS:<BR>

<h3>VQF Systems</h3>
<IMG SRC="vqplayer.jpg" ALIGN="right">

Sound VQ (VQF) is an encoding scheme made by NTT /<BR>
Yamaha. It is quite new and has gained some popularity,<BR>
mainly because of its smaller file size (some 25% smaller<BR>
than MP3) and quite high audio quality. I have been using<BR>
VQF for a year and find it quite ok. Recent developments<BR>
in MP3 and new (read PAC and AAC) techniques, combined with<BR>
lack of VQF development does that I would not recommend it.<BR>
A serious shortcoming is the long encoding times, up to 40<BR>
times that of fastest MP2 encoders.....<BR>
Do check it out, you might like it though.<BR>
It is quite easy with software, there is 1 encoder and<BR>
1 (2?) players available.<BR>
Best VQF programs are:<BR><BR>
RIPPERS:<BR>
EAC 081b (same as MP3.....)<BR>
<BR>

<h3>PAC Systems</h3>
<IMG SRC="playal10.jpg" ALIGN="right"WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="200">

PAC (Perceptive Audio Coding) is made by Lucent Technologies<BR>
and implemented by Celestialtech. The program is  called<BR>
Audiolib 1.0 and it is a encoder-database-player program.<BR><BR>
Encoding speed is high (real-time or better) and sound<BR>
quality is like (best of) MP3 and better than VQF. <BR>
Audiolib/PAC uses its own file-format which is unique,<BR>
ie. no other players will play the files (the database).<BR>
Files and databases can be imported/exported between PAC<BR>
programs. Preferred filesize is 128 kbps.<BR>
<BR>
RIPPERS:<BR>
EAC 081b (like MP3.... next version includes CD-Ripper)<BR>

<h3>Windows WMA systems</h3>
Microsoft launched their new WMA (MS Audio) compression scheme<BR>
with a lot of hype in may 99. It was promised to sund as good as<BR>
MP3 in HALF bitrate and also be very good at much lower bitrates<BR>
still. Well it doesnt seem to do just that, actually it is a bit<BR>
lower sound quality than MP3 in SAME bitrate.<BR>
If MS had believed it themselves they would hardly have uploaded WMA<BR>
files in mono and MP3 files for comparison in stereo (cheap trick!)<BR>
But the quality in lower bitrates are accaptable , like RealAudio<BR>
os so, but for Best Audio Compression i think they have a long way to<BR>
go.Basically it uses a modified VQF encoding (Voxware) and I have<BR>
serious doubt it shall ever be as good as promised.<BR><BR>
Best WMA programs are:<BR><BR>
RIPPERS: EAC 081b (same as for MP2/MP3....)<BR>

<h3>AAC systems</h3>
<img src="bitaac00.jpg" ALIGN="right" width="240" height="100">

MPEG2-AAC is a new encoding system. The main advantage of AAC is<BR>
the better sound quality, CD-like quality in 128 kbps and also<BR>
quite good quality in 96 kbps. The disadvantage of AAC is the long<BR>
encoding time and the cpu-consuming playback, hopefully this will<BR>
improve in the future.<BR><BR>
BitAAC and Homeboy encoder are both "yesterdays news" together with<BR>
Homeboy AAC plug-in for Winamp. Sound quality is NOT on level with the<BR>
other systems. The AAC files are supposed to be compliant with ISO<BR>
specifications, but the sound quality certainly leaves room for<BR>
improvements. It doesnt seem as if there is much (any?) development<BR>
going on.<BR><BR>
<BR>
There is a "new" published AAC encoder published, PsyTel AAC.<BR>
It seems very similar to Homeboy AAC , the encoding speed is<BR>
slow and the sound quality is lower than Astrid 02.<BR>
Naturally this can change and I shall test new version as they<BR>
appear. There also seems to be some problems with ISO compliance<BR>
and thus what player actually plays these AAC files.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Another AAC encoder, Astrid/Quartex came out in october 98.<BR>
Its based on ISO source from NTT and its way better than <BR>
Homeboy/BitAAC. Astrid/Quartex AAC files will only play with <BR>
Kjofol 05x player and are not compliant with other AAC programs.<BR>
It seems that development of Astrid AAC has stopped so maybe we<BR>
have seen the last of it.<BR><BR>
Lately I took part of developing K+K AAC , probably the best AAC<BR>
encoder/decoder made, it was stopped some tima ago, partly because<BR>
the AAC license made it almost impossible to release it and partly<BR>
because we felt that we could do better with TAC. It gives provision<BR>
for ABM (variable bitrate with clever bitrate managing) and also omits<BR>
some of the built-in flaws of AAC.<BR>

<h3>TAC systems</h3>
<IMG SRC="mp02fr00.gif" ALIGN="right" width="240" height="260">

TAC is the only compression (to my best knowledge) which ,together<BR>
with lossless audio compression like LPAC gives true HIFI audio<BR>
compression. <BR>
We have all heard that MP3 is near CD-quality in 128 kbps.<BR>
We have also heard that AAC gives real CD quality in 128 kbps.....<BR>
I am sorry but its isnt true, do some comparisons for yourself,you<BR>
may just compare critical tracks with wav and AAC, there you go.<BR>
<BR>
Of course different tracks require different encoding to achieve the<BR>
best audio quality, we think that our ABM used in TAC is the best<BR>
system built to do just that.If you set the desired quality to the<BR>
highest , thats exactly what you will get. Total transparency to the<BR>
wav file, nothing more and nothing less.

<h3>Hardware - Soundcards</h3>

<IMG SRC="audiopci.jpg" ALIGN="right"width="220" height="150">

A somewhat overseen aspect of sound quality in computers<BR>
is the soundcard. I know that there are lots of them around,<BR>
some are good and many are not so good. Minimum for best audio<BR>
quality is Creative Labs Soundblaster 128 LIVE.<BR>
<BR>
Other good types are Ensonic AudioPCI and TurtleBeach Fiji.<BR>
Specs dont say too much, I may include tests of few cards<BR>
later on. I can recommend the Ensonic cards for best<BR>
performance/price ratio. For real top-quality audio it<BR>
is recommended to use soundcard with S/P DIF output and<BR>
external DA-converter (like the TUrtle Beach.....)<BR>
It is even possible to make your own S/P DIF output on<BR>
a cheap card and get very good audio quality.<BR><BR>
