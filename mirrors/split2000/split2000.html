Before you try Split2000 you'll want to try <A

Then take a look at Split2000, a data compressor for PCM audio with no
cost to you.<P>

If you're doing any intensive work with many generations of audio
files, you need non destructive data compression and split2000 offers a
reasonable solution.<P>

The split2000 algorithm is lossless and non linear.  You can't stream
split2000 files and you can't make reasonable files for internet
downloads, but you can free up an enourmous amount of hard drive space
without degrading the data.<P>

Since it is non destructive your results will vary:

<TABLE>
<TR><TD> 
<FONT FACE=HELVETICA><B>
<LI>Voice applications get almost 60% reduction.</LI>
<LI>Instrumental music usually gets 40%.</LI>
<LI>People who email complaints usually get less than 30%.</LI>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

At least for music a 650 meg CD master can usually shrink to 390
megs.<P>
