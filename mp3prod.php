        alt="FhG MPEG Layer-3 Producer 1.1" align=right height=200></a>
        In the very early days, FhG was still trying to figure out what to do 
        with this MPEG Layer-3 thing they had come up with. Back in 1994-97 they
        were expecting its usage to become limited to the broadcasting industry. 
        They already had that <a href=l3enc.php>l3enc</a> gig going on, but 
        probably felt the technology did not yet reach its full potential.<br><br>
        
        <b><i>A GRAPHICAL INTERFACE!</i></b> &nbsp; - Now that sounded like a 
        good way to improve the technology's usability (and, consequently, its 
        popularity).<br><br>
        
        So they set about creating their Windows GUI encoder. In an extremely 
        fateful decision, they uncoupled the user-accessible interface - which 
        they would call FhG MPEG Layer-3 Producer - from the encoding routines. 
        These would be distributed with the GUI encoder, but as an <a 
        href=fhgcodecs.php>ACM codec</a> that the GUI accessed directly. Not 
        only that, but all Windows applications that wrote WAV files could, in
        theory, also access the MP3 encoding routines. The graphical interface 
        in Layer-3 Producer is nothing more than a frontend to the ACM codec.
        <br><br>
        
        MPEG Layer-3 Producer itself offered a crappy experience - mainly because
        it did not feature batch encoding. The end user had to encode each file
        separately. Besides, it was crazy expensive. The "Advanced" version - 8
        to 56kbps - retailed for 198DM ≈ 128USD in 1997, and the "Professional" 
        version - 8 to 128kbps - retailed for a whopping 779DM ≈ 505USD (remember 
        that back then FhG thought only broadcasters would be interested in the 
        technology, so they had to recoup the development costs somehow).<br><br>
        
        But none of that was a problem! Pirates quickly realized that they could 
        take the ACM codec, repack it with their applications and distribute it
        with no pesky nuisances like cracks or registration keys - just register
        it within the ACM framework at the target machine and you're good to go! 
        That created a whole cottage industry of ACM frontends (which I talk more 
        about at the <a href=fhgcodecs.php>FhG codecs</a> page), which by its  
        turn certainly helped propel the MP3 popularity explosion in the late 
        nineties - at the cost of some lost revenue for FhG related to MPEG 
        Layer-3 Producer sales, but certainly more than compensated with all the
        royalties they were collecting licensing the MP3 encoder patents.<br><br>
        
        Lessons learned, one year later they came up with version 2, now named
        .mp3 Producer. The interface is identical and still sucks (still no batch 
        encoding) but the program is now much cheaper (49USD for the "Advanced 
        Plus" version - 8 to 64kbps + 128kbps - and 199USD for the Professional 
        version, with all bitrates from 8 to 256kbps) because Fraunhofer realized
        MP3 was a runaway success and they would not depend on the broadcasting
        industry for MP3 licensing. At least registered users of Producer v1
        were entitled to free upgrades to v2.<br><br>
        
        <a href="screens/mp3prod2.png" target=outside><img src="screens/mp3prod2.png" 
        alt=".mp3 Producer 2" align=right height=200></a>
        Crucially, .mp3 Producer no longer separated interface from encoder - the 
        encoding routines were built into the main program. That becomes clear 
        when you check the "About MPEG Layer-3 Audio Codec" dialog in both apps:
        MPEG Layer-3 Producer is using <a href="screens/mp3prod11-about.png"
        target=outside>the MP3 codec installed in the system</a> (in my case, a 
        codec much more recent than the one that comes with Producer) while .mp3 
        Producer only uses <a target=outside href="screens/mp3prod2-about.png">its 
        own codec</a>. Also, the installation now requires a serial number 
        (included in the zip file below) to thwart pirates, but by the time .mp3
        Producer was released the cat was already way out of the bag...<br><br>
        
        I guess Fraunhofer never expected even in their wildest dreams that MP3 
        would become so popular - indeed, synonymous with compressed audio. 
        Within an year of the release of .mp3 Producer they stopped developing 
        end-user applications and started focusing on licensing their patents as
        well as their codecs in <a href=fastencc.php>library form</a> to software
        developers.<br><br>
