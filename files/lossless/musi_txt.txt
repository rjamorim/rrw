1.0  Introduction

Soundspace Audio introduces MUSICompress(tm) - a fast, lossless audio compression algorithm
intended for high-quality audio applications.  MUSICompress implements a patent-pending algorithm
which losslessly compresses audio much more effectively and more quickly than alternative,
Lempel-Ziv data compression algorithms. MUSICompress returns a bit-for-bit identical copy of
your original digital audio recording after decom-pression.  And MUSICompress is fast! 
MUSICompress files can be cued (played with random offset) and edited with sample accuracy
in their compressed format.  Finally, MUSICompress' lossy mode offers better compression ratios
with user-specified quality.


2.0  Audio Compression Alternatives

Computer users have regularly been using file-based data compression utilities like PKzip to compress
all kinds of computer files.  Such utilities are only marginally effective on audio files, since their
compression algorithms were developed for text, spreadsheet, and database files. A .zip file can't be
played back before decom-pression, and it can't be cued or edited. Lossy audio compression algorithms
like MPEG, Dolby AC-3, and RealAudio suffer from two drawbacks.  First, they can require lots of
MIPS or dedicated hardware to compress your audio files.  Secondly, they don't give you back your
original audio.  The audio you get after a compression-decompression pass is NOT the same as the
audio you put in, because these algorithms are lossy.  They use psychoacoustic principles to remove
bits you may not miss.  But we believe that many customers actually want all of their original bits.

3.0  MUSICompress (TM)

Soundspace Audio's MUSICompress algorithm is targeted for audio applications where audio quality
is paramount.   MUSICompress was specifically designed to remove the redundancies present in
digital audio or other sampled data signals while perfectly preserving the original waveform, bit for bit.
MUSICompress achieves high compression ratios, typically at least 2:1, often as much as 4:1, using
your 8-bit or 16-bit, mono or stereo digital audio source material as input. MUSICompress processing
is fast, many times faster than playback time.  Finally, MUSICompress files can be cued and edited
with sample accuracy in their compressed format.

6.0  Soundspace Audio

Soundspace Audio is a privately held business located in Sunnyvale, CA (USA).  Soundspace Audio
was founded in September 1995 by Al Wegener, the company's president.   Mr. Wegener is a digital
signal processing (DSP) engineer by training, with a BSEE from Bucknell University and an MSCS
from Stanford University.  With over 15 years of DSP experience and over 5 years in the pro audio
business, Mr. Wegener developed the MUSICompress algorithm specifically to provide a high-quality,
low-MIPS solution for lossless and loss-limited audio compression.  A U. S. patent application for
MUSICompress and related audio compression technologies was filed in April 1996.
