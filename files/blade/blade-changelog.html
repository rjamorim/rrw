<td>
<ul>
<li>
Bugfix: The very uncommon crash on certain WAV files has now been fixed again has been verified to work properly (Andre).</li>
<li>
Modified FFT calculations. Produces the same output and should be slightly faster. However it seems to
produce a slight speed decrease (about 1%) on Tord's computer so any comparisons would be appreciated (Andre).

<li>
Bugfix: Source should now compile nicely on Solaris and any
other UNIX that had problems with 0.94.0 (Tord).</li>
<li>
Bugfix: Fixed a cosmetic error that caused "Press ENTER to exit..." being displayed
even on systems where we don't wait for a keypress.</li>

<td ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE>0.94.0</td>

<td ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE>20010307</td>

<td>
<ul>
<li>
Numerous quality improving changes (Andre).</li>
<li>
Fixed a number of compiler warnings (Andre).</li>
<li>
Included a pre-generated huffman table instead of generating it from
incuded meta-data at initialization. This removed the last memory leaks
and need for the NO_ZERO_CALLOC switch, decreased memory usage and made
the executable about 40 kb smaller (Tord).</li>
<li>
Improved compiler & OS compatibility thanks to a lot of testing, bug
reports and small patches contributed by Chris Rempel, Brad, Jeff Squyres,
Trevor Taylor and Stephen from Minnesota.</li>
<li>
Amiga Warp/OS support added (Andrea Vallinotto).</li>
<li>
Some extra files added to the source distribution,
including makefiles/projectfiles for a lot of environments and an RPM Specfile
(contributed by Jean Robertson, Andrea Vallinotto, Michael Langner and Tord).</li>
<li>
Some minor bugfixes and changes that are too small to mention here.</li>

<td>
<ul>
<li>
Fixed a bug that would cause a crash if BladeEnc was given an 8 bit sample.
(found by Stephen from Minnesota).</li>

<li>
Now compiles properly with the Borland family of C/C++ compilers (thanks to Stephen from Minnesota).</li>

</ul>

<td ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE>20010110</td>

<td>
<ul>
<li>
Some more safe optimizations backported from the 0.93.x branch, resulting in a
speed increase of around 30% on an AMD K6-2 350.(made by Andr&eacute;)</li>

<li>
The config-file can now take filenames, directories, etc with spaces by
enclosing the switch/filename in quotation marks (") (Andr&eacute; & Tord)</li>

<li>
MacOS autodetection added. (Andr&eacute;)</li>

<li>
A lot of compiler warnings etc fixed(Andr&eacute;)</li>

<li>
Some defines for Borland C added (thanks to Stephen from Minnesota), might still not compile without
some more changes though.</li>

<tr NOSAVE>
<td ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE>0.92.5</td>

<td ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE>20001127</td>

<td>
<ul>
<li>
Safe optimizations backported from the 0.93.x branch, resulting in a speed
increase of between 2.5 and 14% on my machine, depending on the bitrate. Can
cause slightly different output (a few bytes being different), but is safe.
(made by Andr&eacute;)</li>

<li>
Changes for gapless encoding backported from the 0.93.x branch, including
the -nogap and -sort switch, making gapless encoding of multiple tracks
possible. (Tord)</li>

<li>
-concat switch added for generating one mp3 file from multiple sources. (Tord and Andr&eacute;)</li>

<li>
Autoconf system rewritten. It's now cleaner, faster etc. (Tord with some help by Jeff Squyres)</li>

<li>
System.h can now autodetect Windows, BeOS and (hopefully) all UNIX systems, making it unnecessary
to set the SYSTEM-define on these systems when compiling. (Tord)</li>

<li>
The manual added to the source distribution and updated some textfiles like AUTHORS and INSTALL. (Tord)</li>

<li>
Changed the way the progress indicator works. Now only updates once a second, speeding up
the process slightly. Disabled the now unnecessary -refresh switch. (Tord)</li>

<li>
OS/2 specific code updates (contributed by Ruediger Ihle).</li>

</ul>

<td>
<ul>
<li>
Code cleanup and optimisations, resulting in a 34% speed increase! (contributed
by Andr&eacute;)</li>

<li>
Encoding a stereo sample to a mono mp3 now works correctly without crashing
the computer (thanks all of you who reported this, sorry for taking this
long to fix it).</li>

<li>
Fixed a lot of small cosmetic bugs having to do with alternative progress
indicators. (thanks to Jeremy Prior for finding one of them).</li>

<td ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE>0.91</td>

<td ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE>991231</td>

<td>
<ul>
<li>
Bugfix: Mono MP3 files now sound as they should again, instead of the seriously
screwed up sound that 0.88 - 0.90 produced.</li>

<li>
Bugfix: Found and fixed a bug that could give you wrong default bitrate
if you combined mono and stereo samples in the same batch.</li>

<li>
Bugfix: Found that locally specified bad bitrates could slip through my
error check and fixed it.</li>

<li>
Improved BeOS support by adding compiler settings for BeOS x86 and code
for reading bladeenc.cfg under BeOS (from the same directory as Bladeenc).</li>
</ul>

<td ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE>991203</td>

<td>
<ul>
<li>
Speed improved with aproximately 10% (mainly thanks to Roger Fujii).</li>

<li>
Added support for a configuration file (only Windows, OS/2 and UNIX systems
so far) where you can change the default settings of BladeEnc. Especially
useful for Windows users who wants to drag-n-drop to encode with higher
bitrates than 128 kBit. :)</li>

<li>
Added support for RAW samples, along with a lot of switches for defining
the format of them.</li>

<li>
Added support for priority settings on UNIX-systems (can be specified in
the range of -20 to +20 as well as the Windows defines).</li>

<li>
Changed the URL for BladeEnc to http://bladeenc.mp3.no.</li>

<li>
Bugfix: Fixed broken last frame in MP3-file (Reported by Robert Schlabbach).</li>

<li>
Bugfix: Long filenames in Windows are no longer truncated (Thanks to Robert
Schlabbach for some help).</li>

<li>
Bugfix: GCC compilation bug finally found and patched (Thanks to Marco
Amrein and Vitor Sessak for some help).</li>

<li>
Bugfix: Found and fixed a bug that could add some noise to the last frame
(few milliseconds) of an MP3 and under certain circumstances also crashed
the DLL.</li>

<li>
Bugfix: A bug in the commandline routines which could confuse BladeEnc
if one or more of the samples had ".mp3" in their body or specified path
was found and fixed by Serg 'Ice' Tsyganenko.</li>

<li>
Support for Linux PPC added (by Rich West).</li>

<li>
Support for Linux Alpha added (by Ben Slusky).</li>

<li>
Added switch -progress=[] for changing look of statusbar.</li>

<li>
Added switch -refresh=[] for changing the refresh rate of the progress
indicator.</li>

<li>
Added switch -nocfg to let BladeEnc skip the configuration file.</li>

<li>
Source code is now distributed with UNIX autoconf support (configure, make
and make install scripts) thanks to KDevelop.</li>

<li>
A lot of restructuring and tidying up in the source code.</li>

<li>
Added code provided by Petteri Kamppuri for his upcoming MAC OS port (to
be released soon, needs some extra source code).</li>

<li>
Added a pause to the info screen after 25 lines on Windows and OS/2 systems.</li>

bugs in my unstable source releases since 0.82 and that way preventing
them from affecting you:</li>

<td>
<ul>
<li>
License changed from simply being "free binaries" to the Lesser General
Public License (LGPL). Sourcecode now available.</li>

<li>
Removed last fragments of copyrighted code and took the opportunity to
tidy up and optimize the affected routines. Removed potential bug and a
minor memory leak as well.</li>

<li>
Ripped out the entire key handling since it never worked quite the way
it should. Encoding is now interrupted with CTRL-C and not Escape under
all UNIX-systems and CTRL-G works as supposed to.</li>

<li>
Added support for STDOUT. All normal text output is done through STDERR
if one or more files use STDOUT for output.</li>

<li>
Fixed the ETA so it won't show negative values when encoding large files.</li>

<li>
Added switch for left/right channel swap: -SWAP.</li>

<li>
Added switch to disable output: -QUIET</li>

<li>
Added switch for only encoding left channel: -LEFTMONO.</li>

<li>
Added switch for only encoding right channel: -RIGHTMONO.</li>

<li>
Changed homepage to http://www.bladeenc.cjb.net.</li>

<li>
Added support for STDIN.</li>

<li>
Got rid of a lot of compilation warnings and got the code compatible with
g++.</li>

<li>
Added displaying of encoding rate for each encoded file.</li>

<li>
Added abbreviations for some switches.</li>

<li>
Fixed broken checksum (CRC) generation. The -CRC switch now generates correct
checksums instead of zeroes.</li>

<li>
Only waiting for key press before quiting on systems where this is considered
as a good thing (Windows and OS/2).</li>
